I am so bummed out these days. I want to rest my brain from thinking. 

Getting sick these recent days. Heartbreaks and emotional rollercoaster happened this week.

Now I don't know how to re-start or go back to my daily productive self.

Just sharing my thoughts. I just want to rest and sleep all day.

Ciao.
