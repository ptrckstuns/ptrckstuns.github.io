## I'm <b>ptrckstuns</b>.
Currently taking degree of Bachelor of Computer Science.

My dream was once to become a Software Engineer and a Project Manager. 
All the project managements I've done during my college, I can say that it's not for me anymore.
At first, I love it doing collaborations, brainstorming, developing projects. and more.
But as the time goes on, I am not into it anymore. The stress, and having a limited knowledge about technologies.

Now, I dream of becoming a VAPT.
Early as a kid, I'm interested about hacking as I watched in mostly Youtube.
CICADA is one of my inspirations, doing their puzzles all around the world.
And one day I hope, I made a good move following my childhood dream.
